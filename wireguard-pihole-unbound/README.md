Pihole is a DNS sinkhole that protects your devices from unwanted content without installing any client-side software. Unbound is a validating, recursive, caching DNS resolver.

  * [Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/mvance/unbound)

This guide combine the three services so that every device that are connected to the VPN also pass through pihole and unbound. Having a VPN will also reinforce security for your overall infrastructure as you can combine it with [traefik IP whitelist](../traefik#Configuration).

  PGID=1000
  ```

# Usage

## Requirements

* A subdomain of your choice for your VPN, this example uses `vpn`.
  * You should be able to create a subdomain with your DNS provider, use a `A record` with the same IP address as your root domain.
* Ports 51820 open, check your firewall.

## Configuration

The linuxserver images are using the PUID and PGID, they allow the container to map the container's internal user to a user on the host machine, more information [here](https://docs.linuxserver.io/general/understanding-puid-and-pgid).

To find yours, use `id user`. Replace the environment variables in `.env` with your own, then run :

```bash
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

### Pihole

Once connected to the VPN you should be able to access the pihole admin interface at http://10.2.0.100/admin, for more information regarding pihole you can check the well written official pihole [documentation](https://docs.pi-hole.net/).

# Update

The images are automatically updated with [watchtower](../watchtower) thanks to the following label :

```yaml
  # Watchtower Update
  - "com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable=true"
```

# Security

Keep in mind that only the containers that have the following label attached will be prone to this IP restriction.

```yaml
  # Ip filtering
  - "traefik.http.routers.service-router-name.middlewares=whitelist@file"
```

# Backup

Docker volumes are globally backed up using [borg-backup](../borg-backup).
